        <p style="padding: 0;" class="col-xs-4">I can't say that I know anything about this elephant but I sure think that elephants are cool.
            I can't actually find a page about this elephant on wikipedia which means it probably isn't of much historical significance
            but I did find youtube footage of it. I'm assuming it was put in the Time top 100 list because they're trying to stay relevant
            and not because the elephant is that influential.

        <p class="col-xs-8" style="margin:0; padding:0;">
            But then again it's really not that big of a deal. Nobody really cares about the 100 best animals and it's just meant to be a fun article.
            I definitely didn't write that just because I wanted to fill in space on the website and had nothing really to talk about. So how was your day?
            I hope you too become part of the top 100 most influential animals of all time (not an insult, humans are animals).
